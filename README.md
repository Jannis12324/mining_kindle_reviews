    - How often do they mention the price
    - Are they content or discontent with the price
- How do customers react to the concept of price reduction for advertising on their Kindles
    - Compare how many of each type (with/without ads) were bought
- How do customers react to the various soft- and hardware features
    - How many customers talk about which soft- and hardware feature?
    - How do the ratings change when they mention a specific feature?
